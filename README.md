My portfolio site using AngularJs, Gulp and Browserify
=================================================

Using **AngularJS**, **SASS**, **Gulp** and **Browserify** to showcase my non NDA work (which isn't much in last two years!)

Recently I have been experimenting with **ES2015**, **RxJs** and **ReactJS** - check it out the code on my [playground page](https://github.com/SirKettle/myPortfolio/tree/master/src/app/views/play) or [view the results here](http://willthirkettle.co,uk/#/play)

---

###System requirements

- [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) **v3.3.0 or higher**: install this with `sudo gem install sass --pre`
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) **v0.13 or higher**: install this with `sudo gem install compass --pre`

_If you receive SASS/Compass errors when building the project, please check that you have the correct version of SASS installed._



###Cloning the repository

Run the following commands to clone the project to your local computer and install the required dependencies:
